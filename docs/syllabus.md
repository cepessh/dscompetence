# Course Syllabus (Approximate Topic List)

## 1) Math Foundations

### Linear Algebra
- Vectors, subspaces, linear independence
- Matrices and basic operations (incl. multiplication)
- Determinant, rank
- Inner product (dot product), orthogonality
- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors

### Calculus & Optimization Basics
- Limits and continuity
- Derivatives in 1D (product rule, chain rule)
- Multivariate calculus: partial derivatives, gradient
- Optimization essentials: first-order and second-order conditions (FOC/SOC)

## 2) Probability Theory Basics
- Counting / combinatorics (as needed for probability)
- Discrete distributions: Bernoulli, Binomial, Geometric
- Conditional probability and Bayes’ theorem
- Expectation, variance, covariance
- Continuous distributions: Uniform, Normal, Exponential
- LLN (Law of Large Numbers) and CLT (Central Limit Theorem)
- Conditional density (and related conditional expectation ideas)

## 3) Statistics & Inference
- Point estimation (what an estimator is, how we use it)
- Confidence intervals
- Hypothesis testing and p-values
- Common tests (when/why/how):
  - z-test
  - t-test (including asymptotic intuition)
  - chi-square test
  - Mann–Whitney U test
- Practical interpretation + assumptions behind the procedures

## 4) Experiment Design & A/B Testing
- Core A/B setup: control vs treatment, randomization
- Metric design
- Sample size basics
- Validation / sanity checks
- Interpreting results (common pitfalls)

## 5) Classical Machine Learning

### Problem Framing & Workflow
- Regression vs classification
- Supervised vs unsupervised (high-level)
- Model selection (typical `scikit-learn` workflow)
- Cross-validation
- Target leakage
- Overfitting vs underfitting

### Evaluation Metrics
- Regression: MSE, MAE
- Classification: ROC-AUC, precision, recall, confusion matrix

### Models
- Linear models:
  - Linear regression, logistic regression
  - OLS
  - Objective as a probabilistic problem (MLE intuition)
  - Coefficient interpretation: significance of coefficients
  - Multicollinearity
  - Bias–variance decomposition (as a guiding mental model)
- Non-linear models:
  - Decision trees
  - Random forests
  - Gradient boosting
