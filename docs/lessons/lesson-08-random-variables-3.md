# Lesson 8 — Pre-lesson self-study (Random variables-3)

## Read 

3.4, 3.7, 3.8 **[BH]**

## Problems

For each problem track and record how much time you spend attempting to solve it.

In each problem follow these steps and write down results of each step. This is a minimal attempt requirements. If you can go further in solving a problem doing some steps 6, 7, ... go on.

0. Restate the question in 1 sentence.
1. Define the random variables: “Let X be ..., Y be ..., etc.
2. State the structure/assumptions (independent trials? with/without replacement? conditioning? etc).
3. Translate the goal into math (e.g., P[X<=k], or define Y=g(X) for some function g, etc).
4. Do the first real step. For example, set up the key sum/product/counting/conditioning formula.

All problems from **[BH]**. These problems are the prerequisites for the first practical HW. Once we finish them the practical HW will be released.

Finish problems 3.8, 3.14, 3.18, 3.19 from the previous HW.

3.41 (independence of r.v.), 3.42 (functions of r.v.) 

3.24, 3.25, 3.28, 3.29 (binomial)

3.30, 3.34 (hypergeometric)

**Idea:** Hypergeometric distribution, functions of random variables, independence
